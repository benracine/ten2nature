### Project specification

- Users will upload videos to [instagram](http://instagram.com/) and/or [twitter](twitter.com) and provide the hashtag __`#ten2nature`__ per the customs of those platforms.
- This site will constantly scrape the [APIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) of those platforms in order to keep the pinterest-like interface populated with lovely things.

- So many more deets to figure out, but... whatever... this is a hippie project... we'll figure things out as we go fuckers.
