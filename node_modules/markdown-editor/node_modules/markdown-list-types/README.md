# Markdown List Types

Converts Latin (a, b, c) and Roman (i, ii, iii) lists to Arabic (1, 2, 3). Can be used as a pre-processor to add Latin/Roman list support to Markdown.

Note that it isn't (yet) intelligent in interpreting whether a list is in Latin or Roman list styles. The letters `i`, `v` and `x` are always interpreted as Roman and the letters `c`, `l` and `m` are always interpreted as Latin. This means that Roman lists can never reach 40 (`xl`) and Latin lists can never reach 9 (`i`).
